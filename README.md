# Botrusu

This is my bot for my private server. It pulls posts and comments from specific subreddits on Reddit.

Its not dynamic. Means you need to add the channel ids manually into the code. You also need to add the client token you get from discord when creating a bot.

To create your discord bot:
- go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
- create application
- get Token and add into the code

For discord channels:
 - Enable developer mode
 - Right-click on a discord channel
 - Copy ID
 - Insert your ID instead of mine.
