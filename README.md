# Botrusu

Bot for a private server. The only task it has is pulling new posts from specific subreddits if flair matches and posts it on the specified discord channel.
Is pretty static but if you know how to add your own discord channels and subreddits feel free to use it.

Attention: You also need to create your own discord bot in discord and add the login thing into the code.

For discord channels:
 - Enable developer mode (not sure how its exactly called)
 - Right-click on a discord 
 - Copy ID
 - Insert your ID instead of mine.
